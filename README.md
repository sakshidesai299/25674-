I cannot access the current files in your local directory or a GitHub repository to create a README.md file. However, I can provide a general README.md template based on the Python and Streamlit project we've been working on. You can copy this template and customize it with the specific details of your project.

Overview
This application provides a user-friendly interface for managers and employees to collaborate on goals and track performance. Managers can set goals, approve tasks, and provide feedback, while employees can view their goals and log their progress. The system includes an automated feedback mechanism via database triggers and provides key business insights.

Features
User Authentication: Secure login for both managers and employees.

Role-Based Access: Different dashboards for managers and employees.

Goal & Task Management: Managers can create goals with due dates and statuses for employees. Employees can add tasks to their goals, which require manager approval.

Progress Tracking: Visual representation of goal status and task approval.

Feedback System: Managers can provide written feedback on goals.

Automated Feedback: A PostgreSQL trigger automatically generates a congratulatory message when a goal is marked as Completed.

Business Insights: A dedicated section with key metrics such as total goals, completion rates, and average completion time.

Performance History: A complete history of past and present goals and feedback for each employee.

Technical Stack
Frontend: Streamlit

Backend: Python

Database: PostgreSQL

Database Driver: Psycopg2

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+

PostgreSQL installed and running

A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code)

Database Setup
Connect to your PostgreSQL server.

Execute the SQL commands provided in the database_schema.sql file (which you can create from the commands I gave you earlier) to set up the necessary tables, functions, and triggers.

Installation
Clone this repository or download the files.

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

Install the required Python libraries:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: You'll need to create a requirements.txt file with streamlit and psycopg2-binary listed in it.)

Running the Application
Ensure your PostgreSQL database is running.

Open the backend_per.py file and update the database connection details with your credentials (dbname, user, password, host).

Run the application from your terminal:

Bash

streamlit run frontend_per.py
The application will open in your default web browser.
